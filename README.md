# Test image
  There are two situations:
  ## test Reimage3k/Dped10k
  ## test your own image
  There are two options:
  1. If you want to test single image, you can run test_ single_ img.py, by modifying the input image and pre-trained model.
  2. If you want to test multiple images, you can run the model_ Test.py. Please use create.py to generate the txt file for the image folder path, and then modify the config_ Test. yaml in the list is sufficient.
# Train your own model


Download Reimage3k datasets in https://pan.baidu.com/s/1mlkVfbyQi3_Fv7GTuilZ0w code is A1B3.
